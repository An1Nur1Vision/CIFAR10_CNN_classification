Project was created by Udacity as part of their Deep Learning Nanodegree

Notes:
This project was fairly time consuming and challenging for me.
I have previously used keras and so this was more significantly more involved.
Overall I enjoyed this project and learned a lot, but I will need to review the project multiple times -- especially the parts completed for us.
